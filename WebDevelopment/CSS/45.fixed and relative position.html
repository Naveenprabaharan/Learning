<h2>French Curves</h2>
<p>French curves are available in different shapes (Fig. 1.4). First a series of points are plotted along
the desired path and then the most suitable curve is made along the edge of the curve. A flexible
curve consists of a lead bar inside rubber which bends conveniently to draw a smooth curve
through any set of pointsFrench curves are available in different shapes (Fig. 1.4). First a series of points are plotted along
