We have collected a great deal of material to help instructors teach courses using
this book. Solutions to exercises, figures from the book, lecture slides, and other
materials are available to instructors who register with the publisher. In addition,
the companion Web site provides links to a free Community Edition of ARM DS-5
professional software suite which contains an ARMv8-A (64-bit) architecture
simulator, as well as additional advanced content for further study, appendices,
glossary, references, and recommended reading. Check the publisher’s Web site for
more information:

Concluding Remarks
If you read the following acknowledgments section, you will see that we went to
great lengths to correct mistakes. Since a book goes through many printings, we
have the opportunity to make even more corrections. If you uncover any remaining,
resilient bugs, please contact the publisher by electronic mail at codARMbugs@
mkp.com or by low-tech mail using the address found on the copyright page.
This edition is the third break in the long-standing collaboration between
Hennessy and Patterson, which started in 1989. The demands of running one of
the world’s great universities meant that President Hennessy could no longer make
the substantial commitment to create a new edition. The remaining author felt
once again like a tightrope walker without a safety net. Hence, the people in the
acknowledgments and Berkeley colleagues played an even larger role in shaping
the contents of this book. Nevertheless, this time around there is only one author
to blame for the new material in what you are about to read.

<h2 id="Acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
With every edition of this book, we are very fortunate to receive help from many
readers, reviewers, and contributors. Each of these people has helped to make this
book better.
We are grateful for the assistance of Khaled Benkrid and his colleagues at
ARM Ltd., who carefully reviewed the ARM-related material and provided helpful
feedback.
xxii Preface
Chapter 6 was so extensively revised that we did a separate review for ideas and
contents, and I made changes based on the feedback from every reviewer. I’d like to
thank Christos Kozyrakis of Stanford University for suggesting using the network
interface for clusters to demonstrate the hardware–software interface of I/O and
for suggestions on organizing the rest of the chapter; Mario Flagsilk of Stanford
University for providing details, diagrams, and performance measurements of the
NetFPGA NIC; and the following for suggestions on how to improve the chapter:
David Kaeli of Northeastern University, Partha Ranganathan of HP Labs,
David Wood of the University of Wisconsin, and my Berkeley colleagues Siamak
Faridani, Shoaib Kamil, Yunsup Lee, Zhangxi Tan, and Andrew Waterman.
Special thanks goes to Rimas Avizenis of UC Berkeley, who developed the
various versions of matrix multiply and supplied the performance numbers as well.
As I worked with his father while I was a graduate student at UCLA, it was a nice
symmetry to work with Rimas at UCB.<br>
I also wish to thank my longtime collaborator Randy Katz of UC Berkeley, who
helped develop the concept of great ideas in computer architecture as part of the
extensive revision of an undergraduate class that we did together.
I’d like to thank David Kirk, John Nickolls, and their colleagues at NVIDIA
(Michael Garland, John Montrym, Doug Voorhies, Lars Nyland, Erik Lindholm,<br>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
Paulius Micikevicius, Massimiliano Fatica, Stuart Oberman, and Vasily Volkov)
for writing the first in-depth appendix on GPUs. I’d like to express again my
appreciation to Jim Larus, recently named Dean of the School of Computer and
Communications Science at EPFL, for his willingness in contributing his expertise
on assembly language programming, as well as for welcoming readers of this book
with regard to using the simulator he developed and maintains.
I am also very grateful to Zachary Kurmas of Grand Valley State University,
who updated and created new exercises, based on originals created by Perry
Alexander (The University of Kansas); Jason Bakos (University of South Carolina);
Javier Bruguera (Universidade de Santiago de Compostela); Matthew Farrens
(University of California, Davis); David Kaeli (Northeastern University); Nicole
Kaiyan (University of Adelaide); John Oliver (Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo); Milos
Prvulovic (Georgia Tech); Jichuan Chang (Google); Jacob Leverich (Stanford);
Kevin Lim (Hewlett-Packard); and Partha Ranganathan (Google).
Additional thanks goes to Jason Bakos for updating the lecture slides.
